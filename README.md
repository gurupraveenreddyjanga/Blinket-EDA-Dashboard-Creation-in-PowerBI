📚 Dataset Summary
Total Rows: 8,523

Total Columns: 13

Source: Retail transaction and outlet master data (internal simulation)

🧾 Column Descriptions
Column Name	Description
S.NO	Serial number (index)
Item Fat Content	Type of fat content (Low Fat / Regular Fat)
Item Identifier	Unique item code
Item Type	Category of the item (e.g., Frozen Foods, Dairy)
Outlet Establishment Year	Year when the outlet was established
Outlet Identifier	Unique ID for each store
Outlet Location Type	Tier of city (Tier 1, 2, 3)

🧹 EDA & Data Cleaning Highlights (Blinket EDA.ipynb)
Standardized Categorical Fields: Cleaned inconsistencies in Item Fat Content

Missing Values: Handled Item Weight nulls with mean/median imputation

Outlier Treatment: Analyzed Item Visibility and Sales distributions

Feature Engineering:

Created new metrics such as Sales per Item Weight

Categorized Item Type groups if needed

📈 Power BI Dashboard Summary (Blinket Report.pbix)
Includes interactive visualizations like:

🔹 Total Sales by Item Type

🔹 Outlet Sales Comparison

🔹 Average Rating & Sales Distribution

🔹 Sales Trend by Year of Establishment

🔹 Sales by Outlet Size/Type

Slicers used:

Item Fat Content

Outlet Type

Item Type

Oulet Establishment Year

KPIs:

Total Sales

Average Rating

Item Category Share

💡 Key Insights
Supermarket Type1 outlets contribute the highest sales volume.

Low Fat items are more frequently purchased.

Newer outlets (post-2015) show increasing sales trends.

Items with high visibility do not always correspond to high sales — indicates product placement isn't the only factor.

🛠 Tools Used
Python: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
